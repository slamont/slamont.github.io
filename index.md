## Today I Learned

### 2018-07-06

Today I learned about the command `run-parts` while looking for information on [hooks with certbot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42300579/letsencrypt-certbot-multiple-renew-hooks).

Its simple description is:
> run-parts - run scripts or programs in a directory

Very useful when you want to add the *dir.d* concept in one of your scripts.
